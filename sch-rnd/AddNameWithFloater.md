AddNameWithFloater
------------------

Names a wire net (or edits the existing name) and automatically
creates a new floating text object for that name (dyntext).
Also has some logic to auto-increment a number entered in the
previous net name (so if you name a net A0 the next one will
automatically suggest A1, etc).

Default keystroke: `{axn}`
